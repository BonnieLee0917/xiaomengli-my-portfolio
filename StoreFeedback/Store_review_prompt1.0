1. You need use scrape_app_reviews_tool to fetch reviews from Google Play and generate one csv file with a prefix "GooglePlay_" and a suffix with the current date in the format YYYYMMDD under working_dir
2. You need use scrape_app_reviews_tool to fetch reviews from iOS App Store and generate one csv file with a prefix "AppStore_" and a suffix with the current date in the format YYYYMMDD under working_dir
3. You need to merge the iOS App Store and Google Play review files into one csv file with a prefix "Store_" and a suffix with the current date in the format YYYYMMDD under working_dir and using the following column headers:
    device, review_id, date, rating, version, country, language, title, text
    If any of the original data is missing a field, leave that field empty (blank) in the final merged table.
4. Use read file tool to get the merged file content, then do following things.
   1. First, categorize each line of content into one of the following three sentiments: positive, negative, or neutral. After categorizing, add the sentiment as a new column in the table for each line of content.
   2. Secondly, categorize the content into the following 67 feature categories: "Ad block/Address Bar/Ads/Appearance/Battery and Memory Consumption/Bing/Camera/Collections/Compatibility/Copilot/Crash/DataLoss/Dark Mode/Desktop Mode/Downloads/Drop/Extensions and Addons/Family Safety/Favorites/Find On Page/Fonts/History/InPrivate/Install and Update/Languages-Locale/Navigation and Controls/New Tab Page/News Feed/Notifications/Outlook Related/Overflow menu/Passwords and Autofill/PDF/Popups/Print/Privacy/Profiles and Identity/Read Aloud/Reading Mode/Resource Utilization/Rewards/Screenshot/Search/Security/Send to Device/Settings/Share/Shopping/Scrolling/Speed and Responsiveness/Spelling/Suggestion/Tabs/Themes/Touch and Pen/Translate/Wallet/Web Media/Webpage Loading/Workspace/Zoom/Others". If the content does not fall into any category, please categorize it as "Others". After categorizing, add the related feature category as a new column in the table for each line of content.

    Please make sure you categorize every line of the file and fill in both the sentiment and feature category columns for each row. Thank you!

5. You need to generate the final csv file after the above steps with a prefix "FinalData_" and a suffix with the current date in the format YYYYMMDD under working_dir
6. Based on the final CSV file, follow these steps:
    1. First, categorize all feedback into three sentiment groups: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
    2. Within each sentiment group, further group the feedback by the 67 predefined feature categories.
    3. For each unique sentiment + feature category combination, generate the following:
       1. The total count of feedback items
       2. A concise summary of the main feedback points
       3. Up to 3 original feedback texts (as individual fields)
    4. Use the generate_pie_chart_tool to create three pie charts (one per sentiment) showing the distribution of feature categories by count and percentage
   
    Output the result in CSV format, using the filename format: 
    ReportResult_YYYYMMDD.csv, saved under working_dir.

    The CSV should use the following column headers: 
    sentiment, feature category, count, summary, original_feedback_1, original_feedback_2, original_feedback_3.
