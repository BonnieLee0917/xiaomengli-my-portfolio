"PDF, Managing files and downloads, Performance & Reliability, Quality, Features & Functionality, Media and Content, Edge mobile, Edge Android","reddit","I've made a [very small site](<gist.github.com...> to reproduce this.  Move the ""<index.html...>"" into a ""templates"" folder if you want to run it - only dependency is Flask, I suggest using [`uv`](<docs.astral.sh...> to download python and add Flask.

So, here's the issue. There'a PDF that's only generated when sending a POST verb to a specific address. By using a web debugging proxy (such as [Fiddler](<www.getfiddler.com...> [mitmproxy](<mitmproxy.org...> [Charles Proxy](<www.charlesproxy.com...> etc) Edge for Android (and only Edge for Android) seems to do a POST request, and then consequently ignore it and do two GET requests for the same URL.

For example:

1. POST <pdfbug.example.com...>
2. GET <pdfbug.example.com...>
3. GET <pdfbug.example.com...>

Edge seems to disregard the first POST completely, and rely on the next GET requests. 
Of course, since in the case of the sample web site the PDF is only sent when using POST, no PDF is actually downloaded or displayed. And in my production site (which triggerred this whole investigation), the PDF file is only generated when the browser is making a POST request anyway.

My sample web site works fine if you select ""attach"" (so that the file is forcefully downloaded as an attachment, instead of being displayd ""inline"").

And to verify that this is indeed a problem with Microsoft Edge for Android, I tried it with other browsers (of course), and on desktop (works fine) and from iOS (works fine as well). Another workaround was to disable the ""Directly view PDF in Tab V2"" by going to the address [edge://flags#edge-new-pdf-viewer-v2](edge://flags#edge-new-pdf-viewer-v2) and disabling that feature.

Of course I may be wrong in my assessment, but I think I've covered all the bases.

Does anyone else have any similar experience? Can anyone else confirm my findings?
