positive,Address Bar,4,4 positive reviews about Address Bar,"Mb the Best browser for Android.

positive,Bing,9,9 positive reviews about Bing,"unlike Google, Bing ranks my company well. Funny... Duck Duck, Freespoke, Firefox, Bing, Yahoo SEARCH... Finds me in top 5. Google puts me way down the list then calls relentlessly to sell me sponsored paid placement. I refuse.",It's my default browser. I enjoy everything about it. I've even learned to enjoy the incorporation of Bing AI.,Works to make your points quota for the day. Just be careful and don't use it along with Bing as your main search engine. If your habit makes you start the day reading the latest news. If you do you risk triggering unusual activity which then not only gives you a 15 minute cooldown for months. You do it enough you can't redeem the points. So if you plan on using it to earn gift cards. I reccomend using it sparingly spreading the searches out especially when you reach level 2.
