        <h4>Collections Feature Not Working Properly</h4>
        <div class="feedback-item negative">
            <p class="quote">"Recently I've encountered a bug on my phone where none of my saved tabs on collections can be opened. I can open each folder and view them, but pressing on the tabs themselves seems to do nothing, though I can open them just fine on my laptop. I tried restarting edge, restarting the phone, and reinstalling edge. Nothing has worked. I can't find anything on the internet regarding this bug either. Does anyone know what might be causing this?"</p>

        <h3>Opportunity Areas</h3>
        <p>Based on the analysis, these areas represent significant opportunities for Microsoft Edge mobile:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Capitalize on performance advantage</strong>: Users frequently praise Edge's performance compared to Chrome, particularly for battery and RAM usage. Consider making this a more prominent marketing message.</li>
            <li><strong>Leverage Copilot integration</strong>: The AI features are a clear differentiator receiving significant positive feedback. Ensuring stability and expanding capabilities could further strengthen this advantage.</li>
            <li><strong>Expand extension support</strong>: The positive reception to uBlock Origin availability suggests users highly value extension support. Consider expanding the extension ecosystem on mobile to differentiate from other mobile browsers.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve cross-device experience</strong>: While synchronization is mentioned positively, fixing the reliability issues and expanding sync capabilities would solidify Edge's position for users in the Microsoft ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>Security as a differentiator</strong>: Users value the security features, and there's interest in advanced capabilities like passkeys. Building on this strength could help attract security-conscious users.</li>
